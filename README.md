# Who is @eatyourpeas?

I am a hospital medic - a consultant paediatrician - working in a teaching hospital in South London, UK. I have worked in general and acute paediatrics for 15 years and have spent a lot of that time thinking about and developing services for young people with eating disorders in particular and teenagers in hospital in general. In the last couple of years I have moved back to work just in paediatric diabetes, obesity and endocrinology, where I started out.

I am married to the amazing [Dr Serena Haywood](https://twitter.com/serenahaywood). We have young adult sons and a retired greyhound, Dusty (racing name 'Sampson Rocket'). We rescue chickens too, but are between chickens right now. Why 'eatyourpeas'? I used to encourage our boys to eat their vegetables a lot when they were littler, and so the name stuck.

I have been coding on and off since the 1980s, but only really properly for the last 5 years - I see software increasingly as a clinical tool, like a stethoscope or a ophthalmoscope. Medics have a long history of collaboration - making and publishing discoveries and innovations for others to use. Somewhere along the line though we lost control of health care tech and we find ourselves consumers of products that often work against us, not for us. For me software is a way of improving healthcare at scale, and I would like to see more clinicians creating and maintaining tools that we can all rely on, to improve patient care and develop new, safe treatments that are available to all.

## Summarise your Github for me in a couple of paragraphs...

The project I am proudest of is the [RCPCH growth charts API](https://github.com/rcpch). This is the first time a medical royal college (the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health) has undertaken to host its own code. Coding a growth chart involves an amazing nerdy mix of interest in childhood growth, stats, charting and data visualisation. The team putting the API together are amazing and I am very privileged to be learning from some of the big names in UK Children's Growth Chart development.

The [npm module](https://github.com/eatyourpeas/growthmethods) was my first attempt at the growth chart algorithm. I worked on the same thing in SqlServer with Chief Clinical Information Office, Dr Jack Barker and this was live at King's College Hospital on our electronic health record for over 10 years, before moving to Epic in 2023.

Another project I am loving is a deep dive into Django 4 with [RCPCH Epilepsy12]([https://github.com/rcpch](https://github.com/rcpch/rcpch-audit-engine). [Epilepsy12](https://www.rcpch.ac.uk/work-we-do/clinical-audits/epilepsy12) is a national audit of the care all children and young people with epilepsy receive in the UK. it comprises a postgres database and front end, with a DRF API. Building the application has gone hand in hand with a review of the audit itself. This is the second partnership I have had with @marcusbaw working with the amazing RCPCH. We have also built [the National Paediatric Diabetes Audit Platform](https://github.com/rcpch/national-paediatric-diabetes-audit) along the same lines. RCPCH now are increasingly building big infrastructure projects and the team as grown into a proper mature software development team. RCPCH have a [playbook](https://playbook.rcpch.tech/).

Another area I have worked in for several years is child and adolescent eating disorders. The assessment of malnutrition of young people with restrictive eating disorders like anorexia nervosa can be difficult and in the past I was part of a group of clinicians called [MaRSiPAN](www.marsipan.org.uk) who seek to set the national standards for this assessment. As part of this, the measurement of BMI in children and its interpretation can be done still using the MaRSiPAN app - this exists in android and iOS. There is a later iteration here too in Flutter, now that MaRSiPAN has been relaunched by the Royal College of Psychiatrists as MEED (Managing Emergencies in Eating Disorders). It is not publised but the code is here for anyone that would like to help brush it up and launch it properly.

Other projects dabble in and around adolescent health or medical training. There are projects in python, javascript/typescript, react, meteor, ionic, android and ios and more recently dart and flutter.
