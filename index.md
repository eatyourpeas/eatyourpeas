## welcome

If you have come here from google and are looking for guidance on using the Bone Age app, there is an explainer [here]({{'./_journey/bone-age.md'| relative_url }}).

Otherwise, for anyone who is interested, this site is both for information on software I have been part of building, as well as my own personal experiences of software development, particularly in health, and particularly in the UK.

There are a lot of similarities between software and medicine. Like medicine, software is fundamentally a collaborative enterprise, ever changing and adapting. It draws from the academic - the advances in computer science and hardware development - but is fundamentally about application. Turning the theory into practice. And also in the same way as medicine, there are different ways of doing things, as well as accepted ways of doing things best. The only way to keep up is to share what you learn and teach others. In the NHS we say 'see one, do one, teach one' and this same mantra could apply just as well to software. This blog is written in that spirit.
